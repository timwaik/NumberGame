# NumberGame

This is a simple text-based game made with Java on the Eclipse IDE.

The objective of the game is to type out the numbers appearing correctly as quickly as possible. The final score is dependant on the number of numbers typed out correctly, as well as the time taken to do so.

If the player chooses to play again, the game calculates whether they have beaten their previous highscore or not.

### Future Work

This code does not implement try-catch blocks for input mismatch selection yet.
